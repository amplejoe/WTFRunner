Mr. Wobble WTF Runner Adventure

The amazing adventure starts with Mr. Wobble eating too much radioactive chili yesterday, well, maybe that doesn't have anything to do with our story, maybe that's  a tale for a prequel...

Today Mr. Wobble decided to stop cursing. It's been one of his bad habits ...  :(

To be successful, he decided to start his good deed with only saying "What the Fooooog!!!", but little did he know his friendly neighborhood fog (who are in no way connected to the chili) did not enjoy it, and thus begins the endless adventure of running away from a gang of angry fog! 

## First steps

Run your project with `yarn start` (or `npm start` if you prefer npm).


## Package Scripts

>   **HINT**: If you prefer npm, run these scripts with `npm run` instead.

```sh
yarn clean     # Manually deletes previous distribution files.
yarn dist      # Prepares the game for distribution.
yarn format    # Uses ESLint to format and remove lint issues.
yarn lint      # Checks scripts for lint issues using ESLint.
```
